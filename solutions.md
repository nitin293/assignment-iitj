1. Result 1
2. Result 2
3. Result 3

## Key nodes involved in the propagatin of synchronization

List them here.

## Basic model simulation (single iteration)

### How many transitions do you see in a single simulation run?
Write a single number here. Also include a plot of the entire timeseries.

### How do you define the transition time?
Write the brief description of how you define the transition time.

### What is the average transition time you observe? Include units!
Write a single number here. You can include a plot that shows all transitions superimposed, aligned to the start time of the transition.

### Include a box plot of the transition times for a single experiment below.
Include the plot here.


## Basic model simulation (different initial conditions)

### Include two box plots below, one for number of transitions and another for transition time
Include the plots here.

## Advanced simulations

### Box plot for number of events
Include the plot here.


### Box plot for transition time
Include the plot here.
